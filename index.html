            <div class="description">I am a graduating Computer Science student from the University of the Philippines - Los Banos. Throughout my stay in the university, I was able to hone my skills in the different fields of programming, especially in Game Development, Database Management, and Web Programming. My programming language of expertise revolves around Python, but I'm also highly knowledgeable on other languages such as C, Java, R, and HTML, CSS, and JS. Speaking of languages, not only I know how to communicate with the computer, but with my peers as well. I believe that proper communication is a powerful tool when it comes to working with other people, which will lead to success.
