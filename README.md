Steps I did to make my Github page.
1) I created a new repository in my github account.
2) I cloned my repository and created an html file.
3) I modified my html file according to the exercise, and did a series of add, commit, and push to my remote repository.
4) I renamed my repository to rdragas1.github.io

This exercise challenged our knowledge in the basic concepts of HTML and CSS. I was able to learn how to use the different attributes of HTML and CSS, giving me a chance to experiment on using flexboxes. I believe that if I would familiarize myself more in using HTML and CSS, I would be able to implement the website designs that come into my mind.
